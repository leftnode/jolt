2010-09-23 06:16
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Removed the sample application for now, stay tuned at joltcore.org for more information. (06:16:16)

2010-09-23 06:12
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Merge branch 'master' of github.com:leftnode/Jolt (06:12:18)

2010-09-23 06:11
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Removed a trailing double quote in the img() method because it was wrong. (06:11:48)
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> In a daring, and one might say blazened checkin, I added all of the code to save session data in a database through PDO. Get this, it's even entirely untested. Crazy, I know, but I needed the functionality and didn't have time to do correct TDD, so it's there. It appears to work, but I can't prove it yet. Rest assured, it will ultimately be tested. Just not now. (06:11:25)

2010-09-23 06:09
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> After the path is extracted from the parameters, it is added to a class level variable with a getter/setter. Because the Router is returned from the \Jolt\Jolt class after execution, this opens up the ability to get the path that was ultimately requested. (06:09:50)

2010-09-23 06:08
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added method getRouter() to return the router after excution. This opens up the ability to get information about the ultimate route/path that was called after final execution. (06:08:43)
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Moved the functionality to check that several objects are set in \Jolt\Dispatcher::execute() to separate methods that also return the object they check if found. Makes for cleaner code and reduces calls to ->. (06:08:09)

2010-09-23 06:05
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> The Controller file is now required to be lowercase because most other files in a Jolt projects (such as the views) are also lowercased. The reason behind my decision was because I wanted to keep everything consistent. (06:05:19)

2010-09-23 06:04
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> If the JOLT_VERSION definition is defined, a new header, X-Framework, is added to the output. This is purely narcissistic and so I can quickly see if a site is really running Jolt, cause that'd be pretty damn badass. (06:04:19)

2010-09-23 06:03
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added a test for array_get() which returns a value from an array if it exists. (06:03:02)

2010-09-23 05:58
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added tests for getPath() and setRouteParameter(). (05:58:01)

2010-09-23 05:47
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added an init() method in the Index controller to test \Jolt\Controller::execute() calls the init() method if it exists. (05:47:25)

2010-09-23 05:36
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Wrapped a strtolower() around the name of the controller file because the Controller class expects this. (05:36:13)

2010-09-23 05:35
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> The included Index controller is now referenced by the right file. This needs to be updated to not have a manual require_once and to rather be loaded automatically. (05:35:46)

2010-09-23 05:33
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added a new class variable for a lowercase version of the controller so that strtolower() doesn't have to be used. (05:33:51)

2010-09-23 05:29
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Renamed the controllers to lowercase filenames so that projects can consistently use lowercase filenames. I think at some point the actual framework will be all lowercase filenames as well. (05:29:40)

2010-09-20 08:44
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Made the controller files always lowercase. (08:44:45)

2010-09-05 17:07
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added a new class getRequestMethod() that returns the resource for now. Will eventually return the actual request method. (17:07:09)

2010-09-05 17:06
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> The Exception messages are more meaningful now. (17:06:39)

	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Copied the Exception class from DataModeler to make it more useful in it's debug information. (17:04:11)

2010-09-05 17:03
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Two new tests added for addRouteList(). (17:03:45)
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Whitespace cleanup. (17:03:28)
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> The Exception message from render() is more meaningful now. (17:03:15)

2010-09-05 17:02
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> The Exception messages are more meaningful now, and added new method addRouteList() to add an array of routes in one fell swoop. (17:02:43)

2010-08-27 07:17
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Added the Route.php file to always be included so code coverage can be completed if running individual tests. (07:17:30)
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Moved the providerInvalidJoltObject() dataProvider to testCase since it's the same function in multiple files. (07:17:02)

2010-08-27 07:16
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Consolidated some of the view methods, and wrote tests for all of the helper methods. (07:16:28)

2010-08-27 07:15
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Removed an old conditional when an empty path was found. In that case, it should go to the first matched path or the 404 Path. (07:15:30)

2010-08-26 20:36
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Renamed Bootstrap.php to bootstrap.php. (20:36:03)

2010-08-14 07:13

	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> For local files, made them absolutely linked so they'll work in 'subdirectories'. (04:48:31)

2010-06-01 05:17
	* Vic Cherubini <vmc@leftnode.com> Removed setRestfulRouteList() and setNamedRouteList() (or rather, combined them into a single method because two aren't necessary), and updated execute() to take a \Jolt\Dispatcher object to dispatch the matched route. (05:17:40)
